### Effect of Age on Hospital Visits - Econometrics Project
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

# Project Overview:
This project analyzes the relationship between age and hospital visits, using econometric models to explore whether age alone is a significant predictor of healthcare utilization. Our study controls for confounding factors such as health conditions, income, gender, access to healthcare, and family structure.

# Research Question:
What is the effect of age on hospital visits?

# Abstract:
People often associate old age with increased health concerns, but does age directly correlate with the number of hospital visits? We explore this question by regressing the number of hospital visits on age and multiple other factors. Our findings indicate that being older and having more children negatively impact hospital visits, whereas health conditions and enrollment in Supplemental Security Income (SSI) increase hospital visits. Other factors, such as gender and income, did not appear to have a significant impact.

# Dataset:
- Data originates from Santa Barbara and Ventura counties (1986)
- Includes demographic, economic, and health-related factors
- Notable limitations: missing middle-age groups (58-63), female-biased sample (85%)

# Methodology:
- Descriptive Statistics & Visualizations
- Summary statistics for age, hospital visits, income, health conditions, children, and program enrollment
- Bar plots & line plots to explore trends in visits and age
- Econometric Modeling & Regression Analysis

# Baseline Model: 
Visits ~ Age, Health Condition, Children, SSI Program

# Alternative Specifications: 
Quadratic & cubic age terms, interactions between income and gender
Sub-sample analysis: Separate regressions for younger (<55) and older (≥55) individuals
Hypothesis Testing & Model Evaluation

# T-tests & F-tests to compare linear vs. cubic age effects: 
Adjusted R² & significance levels to determine explanatory power

# Key Findings:
- Age alone is not a strong predictor of hospital visits; health status, SSI enrollment, and number of children are more influential
- Health conditions have a significant positive impact on visits (p < 0.05)
- Having more children reduces hospital visits, especially for younger individuals
- SSI enrollment increases hospital visits, but this effect is only significant for older individuals
- Income, gender, and healthcare access were not statistically significant predictors
- Limitations & External Validity
- Potential omitted variable bias (e.g., fitness levels, lifestyle factors)
- Sample selection bias (overrepresentation of females, missing middle-age groups)
- Limited external validity (data specific to 1986 in two California counties)
